Description: It is used to associated with disease-drived differential proteins and 
  proteome-wide co-expression network. It provides the essential analysis included 
  t.test, ANOVA analysis to extract differential proteins. The network construction is
  genereated by WGCNA package. The package also provide some module analysis included
  PCA analysis, two enrichment analysis, Planner maximally filtered graph extraction
  and hub analysis.
