}
\description{
Pick up proteins based on foldchange and return proteins position in data.
}
\usage{
fc.pos(fc, vs.set2, vs.set1 = "WT",
       cutoff = 1, datatype = c("none", "log2"),
       fctype = "all", order = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{fc}{
proteomic data of mean value in groups.
}
  \item{vs.set2}{
compared group 2 name
}
  \item{vs.set1}{
compared group 1 name
}
  \item{cutoff}{
a numberic value indicated foldchange threshold.
}
  \item{datatype}{
The quantification data is normal data or log2 data.
This must be (an abbreviation of) one of the strings "\code{none}","\code{log2}".
}
  \item{fctype}{
foldchange is ordered by up-regulated or down-regulated or changed
}
  \item{order}{
a logical value indicated that whether ordered by foldchange.
